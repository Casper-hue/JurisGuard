      "fullText": "In Apple Inc. v. Epic Games, Inc., the Supreme Court addressed antitrust claims challenging Apple's App Store distribution practices. Epic Games alleged that Apple violated federal antitrust laws by maintaining a monopoly on iOS app distribution and charging developers a 30% commission fee. The Court ruled that Apple must allow developers to link to payment methods outside of the company's in-app purchase system, though it rejected Epic's claim that Apple was a monopolist under antitrust law. The decision has significant implications for digital marketplaces and platform governance.",
